                        <p>This was anothe project I had to create for college. I designed a chess game using python and pygame. It worked in a technical sense but I've wanted to port it to unity so it would run better. The whole idea is based around a series of numbers and letters organised into whats called FEN notation. You can add as many different FENs as you want to the game. Therefore you can play out any scenario you want. There is also a random setting in the code you can change around to just spam random games. I never got it to be fully end less but it can run for a while and it's pretty good for killing time.</p>
