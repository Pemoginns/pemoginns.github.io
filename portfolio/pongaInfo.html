                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            This was a game I developed in 2rd year of university on using python with pygame framework.<br>
                            the aim of the game is simple. It's designed to waste time. In an ideal world, I would have fully developed this game. <br>
                            The concept of the game is essentailly pong but with a twist. The player (sqaure) has to try to bounce the ball into the green square <br>
                            before the time runs out. Every round gets quicker paced and occasionally an rectangle or polymorph would spawn. <br>
                            After the player achieves the goal. The idea of the game is so simple, I'd like to redevelop it with javascript and make it publicly available on github
